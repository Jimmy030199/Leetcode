    <h2>
      A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a
      dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... ->
      sk such that: Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
      Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need
      to be in wordList. sk == endWord Given two words, beginWord and endWord,
      and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest
      transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such
      sequence exists.
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example 1: Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList =
        ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"] Output: 5 Explanation: One
        shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" ->
        cog", which is 5 words long.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example 2: Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList =
        ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"] Output: 0 Explanation: The endWord "cog"
        is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
